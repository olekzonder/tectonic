# tectonic_bridge_harfbuzz 0.2.2 (2021-06-07)

- Still no code changes
- 0.2.1 didn't publish to Crates.io because our package file was too big for it;
  we've eliminated some of the Harfbuzz support files that should fix this
  ([#781], [@pkgw])

# tectonic_bridge_harfbuzz 0.2.1 (2021-06-07)

- No code changes
- The 0.2.0 package didn't actually contain the vendored Harfbuzz source files,
  breaking `cargo` builds. Weâ€™ve modified the CI scripts to attempt to fix this
  ([#777], [@pkgw])

  crates. This is a breaking change: we've moved from a single include directory
  to a list of them.
